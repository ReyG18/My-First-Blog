# My-First-Blog

## Description

My first blog consisting of 2 web pages, where users will be able to input information in a form on
one page and view it as a blog post on another.

## Success

**HTML Files**

- Both index.html and blog.html files are function as designed.
- Script links are working.
- Both webpages display well for any given screen size.

**CSS Files**

- light/dark mode themes are defined and toggle as designed.
- Used flexbox for organization.

**JavaScript Files**

- Event listener for the submit button function as designed.
- Successfully printed form input from index.html to blog.html using localStorage.
- Event listener will return if any field is left blank.
- An alert box will appear, alerting users to fill in all fields.
- Upon light/dark mode toggle, button emoji will change from a sun to a moon and vice versa.


## Challenges

One major challenge was trying to create a new 'card' object for each form submission. I was unable to stop localStorage from being overwritten by new form submissions, therefore, I was unable to create new cards storing new form input.
